# GroupRugs Visual Summaries
This work is a continuation on the insightful work of [Buchm√ºller et al.](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg/2019/01/08440823/17D45W2WyxW) (2019) and [Wulms et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438758) (2021) on MotionRugs visual summaries for visualizing trajectory data. MotionRugs visual summaries are a novel data visualization technique for visualizing trajectory data in a way that enables a quick overview of movement characteristics such as speed or direction of entities over time. We have used their publicly available repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jbuchmueller/motionrugs/tree/master).

GroupRugs visual summaries are a continuation on MotionRugs visual summaries where additional space is added in the visual summary to indicate group structure. This was suggested as an interesting research opportunity by [Wulms et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438758) (2021). The GroupRugs visual summaries code in this repository can be found in: src\main\java\dbvis\visualsummaries\grouprugs.
